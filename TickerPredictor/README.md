# **_ML.NET TickerPredictor Demo Console App_**

- **ML.NET** demo console app for converting non-deterministic stock names/tickers/company names into
  standardized stock ticker names. It solves the issue of correcting incorrect inputs like **"AMAZO"** to **"AMAZON"**
  and standardizing different country codes such as **"AAPL US"** and **"AAPL LN."** without using Fuzzy libraries.


- It also highlights how **ML.NET**, with its higher level of abstraction, offers an easier solution for common tasks
  such as this, compared to **Python** (especially for **.NET** devs).

> Mostly based on the [dotnet/machinelearning-samples](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-samples) on GitHub.
